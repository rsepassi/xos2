xos was built to support a new cross-platform platform, akin to a browser but
with some different goals (which are discussed elsewhere).

Platform features include:
* Support for iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and MacOS
* A declarative reactive UI system with support for
  * text, images, 2D graphics
  * mouse, keyboard, and touch inputs
  * animations
* Audio (speaker and microphone) support
* Public-private key authentication, signing, and encryption
* Filesystem and database access (key-value and relational)
* Peer-to-peer messaging and networking
* End-to-end encrypted synchronization (optionally with CRDTs)
* Dynamic Wren scripts (akin to JavaScript in a browser)
* Filetypes: jpeg, png, gif, wav, mp3, ogg, epub, txt, md, xml, csv

Future support for:
* PDF
* Video
* ODS
* WebAssembly

Dependencies:
* UI: wgpu, freetype, harfbuzz, nanovg
* Inputs: glfw
* Filesystem: libuv
* Network: libuv, libcurl
* Database: lmdb, sqlite
* Audio: miniaudio
* Encryption: monocypher, mbedtls
* Compression: zstd, xz
* Build: xos, zig
