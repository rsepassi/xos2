Cache artifacts
---------------

.xos-cache/: All cache state and artifacts are in this directory at the repo root
  content/: Content-addressed (SHA256) artifacts, typically from downloads
  tools/: Custom cache directories managed by tools, keyed by the tool's label key
  label/: Cached label artifacts, keyed by label key

label/00/0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/
  ok: A label directory is valid/complete iff this is present
  deps.json: All dynamically tracked dependencies
  out/: Label's output directory, opaque to xos
  home/: Temporary directory used during the label's build, opaque to xos

deps.json: Dynamically marked dependencies
  files: files from the label's src directory
  directories: directories from the label's src directory
  content: content-addressed artifacts
  labels: other labels
  imports: other imported Wren modules

label key: This key identifies a label output, not including its dependencies
  SHA256(
    xos_id
    label
    label arguments, in the order passed
    build arguments (opt, target)
    build script hash (e.g. SHA256(foo/bar/build.wren))
  )

Output identification
---------------------

To identify a specific output directory, we recursively hash the label key and
deps.json.

OutputHash = Hash(label key, deps.json, map(OutputHash, deps.json[labels]))

This allows for shared caches with precomputed output keys.

Notes
-----

* Maybe tools should be specified in deps.json separately so that they can be
  built for the currently invoking host instead of for the originally invoking
  host?
* Other imported modules need to be included
