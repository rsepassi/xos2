# todo

* Memory corruption bug
  Could not change current working directory
  Unrecognized file extension
  Garbage collection?
* dynamic label creation?
* implement external repos - repo name mapped to url
* documentation
* Increase concurrency: Fibers in dependency and file loops, batch apis
* detailed review of caching policy
* tests
* UCL configuration parser (e.g. for repo specification)
* Tracking license, version url, documentation
* Cloud cache
* Cache untar results if from content? (using dynamic labels?)
* Verify Windows, FreeBSD builds
* xos cache tools, see ids, etc
* add b.system to access system path without export
* Should system usage be marked in the output somehow? May be important for
  cloud caching (either not allowed, or some configurable hashing function)
* Allow for aliases, i.e. a target that is an alias for another label, without
  having to re-export the output directory
* Move logging to wrencli, add debug logging to Process.spawn
* Wren package manager
* Add ccache for zig cc invocations
