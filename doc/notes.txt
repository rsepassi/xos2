# todo

* dynamic label creation? Maybe just allowing deps to be passed as arguments?
* implement external repos - repo name mapped to url
* documentation
* Increase concurrency: Fibers in dependency and file loops, batch apis
* detailed review of caching policy
* tests, CI
* UCL configuration parser (e.g. for repo specification)
* Tracking license, version url, documentation
* Cloud cache
  need to resolve paths in label outputs pointing to other rule outputs
* Verify Linux, Windows, FreeBSD builds
* xos cache tools, see ids, etc from info.json
* Should system usage be marked in the output somehow? May be important for
  cloud caching (either not allowed, or some configurable hashing function)
* Allow for aliases, i.e. a target that is an alias for another label, without
  having to re-export the output directory
* Move logging to wrencli, add debug logging to Process.spawn
* Wren package manager
* Add ccache for zig cc invocations? Only for rust?
* Filter error stack traces?
