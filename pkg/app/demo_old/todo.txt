* Access to system fonts
* Investigate nanovg color issues, consider switching to nanovg-zig

* Review resource binding order for change frequency
  Do: group resource bindings by the change frequency, start from the lowest.
  For example, put per-frame resources into bind group 0, per-pass resources into
  bind group 1, and per-material resources in bind group 2. This allows the
  WebGPU implementation to keep the other bindings intact, reducing the state
  changes.
* Review color spaces, remove manual gamma correction
